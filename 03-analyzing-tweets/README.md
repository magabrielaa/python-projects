# Analyzing Candidate Tweets

- `basic_algorithms.py`: Contains my code for Part 1 for analyzing candidate tweets

- `analyze.py`: Contains my code for Parts 2 and 3 for analyzing candidate tweets

- `get_files.sh`: A script for downloading the data. Running it will add a data/ subdirectory.

- `load_tweets.sh`: Code for loading the tweets in the data set in Python (after the data has been downloaded).

- `util.py`: Code containing helper functions. I only use the function sort_count_pairs directly.

- `test_basic_algorithms.py` , `test_analyze.py`: The automated tests.

- `test_helpers.py`: Helper functions for the automated tests. No need to interact with this file directly.

- `tests/`: A directory containing files specifying the tests.

- `pytest.ini`, `.gitignore`: Configuration files.

- `sample_cities/`: A directory with a few sample city files.
